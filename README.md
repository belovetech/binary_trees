# binary_trees

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX Africa. It aims to learn about what is a binary tree, the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree (pre-order, in-order and post-order) and the different types of binary trees (complete, full, perfect and balanced).
